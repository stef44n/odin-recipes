# odin-recipes
First Odin project - recipes

After completing this project I will demonstrate the ability to use the basic HTML tags and commands.
I will be able to structure the website with headings, paragraphs, and lists as well as linking pages.
Also I will have used images.
After creating one of the webpages I will copy the structure of it and paste that in for the other pages.
